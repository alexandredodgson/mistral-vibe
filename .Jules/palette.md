## 2026-02-06 - [Consistency & Discoverability]
**Learning:** In a TUI, interactive elements like collapsible sections need explicit affordances. Reasoning blocks were clickable but Tool results weren't, creating an inconsistent experience. Adding tooltips and unified click-to-toggle behavior across all collapsible components improves discoverability and user confidence.
**Action:** Always ensure similar components (e.g., status/result blocks) share the same interaction patterns and provide tooltips for non-obvious interactions.
